# Flash message types

Typically with flash messages you would set your flash message with a type like below:

* error
* warning
* success
* info

However, Phlash has no predefined types? What, why? Well, there is no need, by not having any predefine types Phlash is more suitable for everyone to use it in the way they want. If you want to use Phlash with the Bootstrap set of alert types, then hey you can. If you want to use it with your own custom types then you can.
